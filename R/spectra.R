#' Calculate overlap between proteins
#'
#' Calculates the pairwise overlaps in area under an emission spectra between 
#' proteins. Areas are calculated by taking into account the specified 
#' channels and excitation by given laser wavelength. Pairs are constructed
#' from all combinations of the given proteins and overlap is reported
#' as a fraction of the area of the second protein in a given pair. For example, 
#' the overlap of EGFP by EYFP will likely be different from the overlap of 
#' EYFP by EGFP. An overlap of NA means that the area of the second protein is
#' 0 for the given channel (and would result in division by 0). An overlap of
#' 0 means that the relative area of overlapping proteins is practically 0.
