\title{Calculate overlap between proteins}
\usage{
calculate_pairwise_overlap(wavelengths, excitations, emissions, proteins,
  lasers, channels, threshold = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{wavelengths}{A vector of wavelengths (nm).}

\item{excitations}{A vector of excitation intensities.}

\item{emissions}{A vector of emmision intensities.}

\item{proteins}{A vector of protein labels that correspond to each
measurement.}

\item{lasers}{Vector of lasers exciting given proteins e.g. c(488, 642).}

\item{channels}{Vector of channels for which spectral area is calculated
e.g. c('530/30', '670LP').}

\item{threshold}{Fraction of total spectral area observed in a given
channel that is considered to be practically 0.}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns -- protein1, protein2, channel 
        and overlap. Overlap represents the fraction of protein1 area
        occupied by protein2 in a given channel.
}
\description{
Calculates the pairwise overlaps in area under an emission spectra between 
proteins. Areas are calculated by taking into account the specified 
channels and excitation by given laser wavelength. Pairs are constructed
from all combinations of the given proteins and overlap is reported
as a fraction of the area of the second protein in a given pair. For example, 
the overlap of EGFP by EYFP will likely be different from the overlap of 
EYFP by EGFP. An overlap of NA means that the area of the second protein is
0 for the given channel (and would result in division by 0). An overlap of
0 means that the relative area of overlapping proteins is practically 0.
